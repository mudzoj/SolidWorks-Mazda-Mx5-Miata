## Improvements

While I am incredibly proud of the work done on this project, there are some areas for improvement:

- **Blue Lines on Surfaces:** The blue lines visible within the model are caused by issues with surface continuity and the way surfaces were patched together. This can be improved by ensuring that all surface edges are properly trimmed and knitted together, which will create a more seamless appearance.
  
- **Detail Enhancements:** Adding more intricate details to smaller components like the dashboard buttons or seat stitching can enhance the realism of the model.
